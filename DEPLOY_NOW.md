## 🐛 **If You Have Issues**

### **Issue: "Cannot access camera/microphone"**
**Solution:** Your app is deployed with HTTPS, so this should work. Make sure to click "Allow" when browser asks for permissions.

### **Issue: "App not loading"**
**Solution:** Check browser console (F12) for errors. The app should work on Chrome, Firefox, Safari.

### **Issue: "Video call not starting"**
**Solution:** 
1. Check browser console for WebRTC errors
2. Try different browser
3. Test WebRTC support at `/webrtc-test`
