## Your Google OAuth Configuration

**Client ID**: `948018453978-vmbjm6pg8o0hcltbuac6e792mqvj7hmo.apps.googleusercontent.com`
**Redirect URI**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`

## How to Test Google Sign-In

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`
3. Click "Continue with Google" 
4. Complete the Google sign-in flow
5. You'll be redirected to the dashboard after successful authentication

## Production Setup Checklist

When deploying to production, make sure to:

### 1. Update Google Cloud Console Settings
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
- Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- Add your production domain to "Authorized redirect URIs":
  - `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

### 2. Update Environment Variables
```bash
# In your production .env file
NEXTAUTH_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

### 3. Verify Domain Ownership
- In Google Cloud Console, add your production domain to "Authorized domains"
- This prevents Google from blocking sign-ins on your live site

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "redirect_uri_mismatch" error
**Solution**: Make sure the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console exactly matches:
- Development: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`
- Production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/auth/callback/google`

### Issue: "access_blocked" error in production
**Solution**: 
1. Verify your domain in Google Cloud Console
2. Add domain to "Authorized domains" list
3. Ensure OAuth consent screen is properly configured

### Issue: Users getting signed out immediately
**Solution**: Check that your `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is set and consistent across deployments

## Next Steps

Your Google Sign-In is working perfectly! Consider adding:

1. **User onboarding flow**: Create `/onboarding` page for new users
2. **Profile completion**: Collect additional user information after sign-in
3. **Error handling**: Add better error messages for authentication failures
4. **Sign-out functionality**: Add sign-out buttons in your app
