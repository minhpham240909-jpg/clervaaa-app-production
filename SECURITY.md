## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Environment Validation (`lib/env.ts`)
- Validates all required environment variables at startup
- Prevents application from starting with invalid configuration
- Provides clear error messages for missing variables

### 2. Rate Limiting (`lib/rate-limit.ts`)
- Implements rate limiting for API endpoints
- Different limits for different endpoint types
- Prevents abuse and DoS attacks

### 3. Input Validation (`lib/validation.ts`)
- Comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas
- XSS protection with DOMPurify
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM

### 4. Authentication Security (`lib/auth.ts`)
- Secure session configuration
- HTTP-only cookies
- CSRF protection
- Session timeout

### 5. AI Service Security (`lib/ai.ts`)
- Input sanitization for AI prompts
- Prompt injection protection
- Content filtering
- Cost controls

### 6. Monitoring System (`lib/monitoring.ts`)
- Real-time application monitoring
- Security event tracking
- Performance metrics
- Automated alerting

### 7. Privacy Management (`lib/privacy.ts`)
- GDPR compliance features
- Data retention policies
- User data export
- Account deletion

### 8. Security Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Security headers
- Request tracking
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Performance monitoring

## Security Headers

The application includes the following security headers:

- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - XSS protection
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` - HTTPS enforcement

## API Security

### Rate Limiting
- Chat API: 10 requests per minute
- Authentication: 5 attempts per 15 minutes
- General API: 100 requests per minute

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- XSS protection with DOMPurify
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- Request size limits enforced

### Authentication
- All API endpoints require authentication
- Session-based authentication with NextAuth.js
- Secure cookie configuration
- CSRF protection

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Metrics Tracked
- API response times
- Error rates
- Database performance
- Security events
- User activity

### Alerts Configured
- High error rate (>10%)
- Slow response time (>5s)
- Database errors (>5 in 5 minutes)
- Security incidents

## Privacy & GDPR

### Data Rights
- Right to access (data export)
- Right to rectification
- Right to erasure (account deletion)
- Right to portability

### Data Retention
- Default retention: 1 year
- Maximum retention: 7 years
- Automatic cleanup of expired data
- User-configurable retention periods

## Incident Response

### Security Events
1. **Suspicious Requests**: Logged and monitored
2. **Rate Limit Exceeded**: Blocked temporarily
3. **Authentication Failures**: Tracked and alerted
4. **Database Errors**: Monitored and alerted
5. **Performance Issues**: Tracked and reported

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring detects issues
2. **Alerting**: Immediate notification of security team
3. **Investigation**: Log analysis and impact assessment
4. **Mitigation**: Immediate action to contain threat
5. **Recovery**: System restoration and monitoring
6. **Post-Incident**: Analysis and prevention measures
